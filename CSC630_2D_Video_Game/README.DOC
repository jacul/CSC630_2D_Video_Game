HOW TO COMPILE:
If you are using Mac, create a C++project, and add all these files to the project. Add Glut.framework and OpenGl.framework to your project. Then press cmd+R and it will run automatically. If you are using Windows, add all files to a Visual Studio project, and press Run to run.

HOW TO PLAY:
The goal of this game is to eliminate all the evil things and kill as few good things as you can. So, drop a bomb on these moving things by clicking your left mouse button. Press middle mouse button to start/ resume and pause game. Right click to enter debug mode.
By killing one bad thing, you gain scores. Killing good things will make you lose scores. If you kill all the bad things, you win. If you kill so many good things that makes your score negative, you lose. Also, dropping bombs consumes score. If you drop many bombs but gain no score, you might lose since your score is negative.
Every 15 seconds, there will be more good things and bad things. So move fast before it's getting too crowded.
Have fun!
